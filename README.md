OpenSorbents was created mainly by Emanuele Piccoli under the supervision of Sandra Galamrini. Ricardo Silva and Riccardo Torreggiani contributed to the creation of certain parts of the code.

This library is a collection of codes and scripts used during the development of the PhD thesis by Emanuele Piccoli: Selection and Optimal Use of Nanoporous Materials for Adsorption Energy Technologies, EPFL, 2023.

It contains the codes used to validate and implement mathematical methods of analysing adsorbent materials for the investigation of innovative applications.
The libraries necessary to run the codes are not included.

The user will need to have Modelica 1.16.5 and Python 3 installed on their machine.

While OpenSorbents is still not fully self-explaining and user-friendly, it gives the necessary basic information for reproducing some of the results of the thesis and understanding the underlying data processing.
